VBA Challenge

  This project was an excerise in using VBA to read and analyze data across multiple Excel data sheets. This was done by implementing a series of for loops to read the data, scan for certain patterns, such as variations in stock tickers, and both pull and anaylze the data. These for loops utlized a series of conditionals that helped the VBA script find the variations and patterns, as well as work through the large variety of date without becoming overloaded. I started this project by having the VBA script compile a list of the different ticker names, then used a second for loop to tally up the total stock volume for each stock. The third and final loop was used to determine the year open values, the year close values, the change between the two, and the percent change. Conditional formatting ws applied to the yearly chage format to alter the cells to turn green if they have a posistive value, and red if they are negative. Finally, the data compiled by the VBA script was then anayalzed to determine which stock had the greats percent increase, which had the greatest percent decrease, and which had the largest total stock volume for the year.
